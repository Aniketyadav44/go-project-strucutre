### Directory Descriptions

- **cmd/**: Contains the main application entry point.

  - **api/**: This directory holds the `main.go` file, which starts the HTTP server.

- **internal/**: Contains application-specific logic that is not intended for external use.

  - **config/**: Manages configuration settings and application parameters.
  - **handlers/**: Contains HTTP handlers that define how requests are processed.
  - **services/**: Contains business logic and interacts with data models.
  - **models/**: Represents the data structures used in the application.
  - **middleware/**: Holds middleware functions for request processing.

- **pkg/**: Contains reusable code that can be imported by other applications.

  - **responses/**: Functions for creating standardized responses.
  - **utils/**: General utility functions that provide common functionality.

- **api/**: Contains versioning for your API to manage changes without breaking existing clients.

  - **v1/**: Holds routing setup for version 1 of the API.

- **tests/**: Contains unit tests and integration tests for various components of the application.

- **go.mod** and **go.sum**: Standard Go module files for managing dependencies.

- **README.md**: Documentation providing an overview of the project and instructions for setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.20 or higher)
- Git

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aniketyadav44/go-project-strucutre.git
cd go-project-strucutre
```

### Renaming to your project

- Open the `go.mod` file and change the module path to your new desired path:

  ```go
  module github.com/yourusername/your-new-project-name
  ```

- Rename the Project Directory:

  ```bash
  mv go-project-strucutre your-new-project-name
  ```

- Update Repository URL (if using Git):
  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-new-project-name.git
  ```

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### Run the Application

To start the application, run:

```bash
go run cmd/api/main.go
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use:

```bash
go test ./...
```
